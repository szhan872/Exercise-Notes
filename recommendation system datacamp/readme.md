# Recommendation System Exercise: My Journey

Hello! This repository is a showcase of my journey through a recommendation system exercise that I undertook from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

## About The Course I Took

The online world today is driven by **personalized experiences**, be it Netflix's uncanny knack for predicting what we'd love to watch next, or e-commerce sites seemingly reading our minds with product suggestions. I've always been curious about the machinery behind these recommendations. This course gave me those insights.

### Here's what I've explored and learned:
- **Understanding Recommendation Engines**: Delved deep into what powers these nifty systems.
- **Distinguishing Collaborative and Content-based Filtering**: Grasped the key differences and applications of the two main methods.
- **Metrics & Similarities**: Learned to measure how 'alike' things are with metrics like the Jaccard distance and cosine similarity.
- **Evaluating Recommendations**: Got hands-on with evaluating recommendation quality using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
- **Building My Own Engine**: Yes, I've built my own movie recommendation engine by the end of it!

The Python skills I've honed here can now be applied to create recommendation systems across any domain. Exciting times ahead!

## Repository Overview

- `data/`: This is where I stored the datasets I worked with.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks that chronicle my step-by-step progress.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts I wrote for the different parts of the recommendation system.
- `README.md`: Well, you're reading it!

## How to Navigate My Work

1. Feel free to clone or download this repository.
2. Begin by exploring the `notebooks/` directory. I've started with basic concepts and gradually moved to complex implementations.
3. The `scripts/` directory will give you an insight into the Python code I've written.

## Shoutout
